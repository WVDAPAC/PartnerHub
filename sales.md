## Introduction
This page is intended to provide insight, guidance and resoureces for partner sales teams to leverage in first understanding then positioning Windows Virtual Desktop as a key service to help customers become enabled for remote work.  

## Overview
Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) is a service exclusive to Microsoft Azure which allows remote user access to a managed corporate Windows desktop environment. It provides some compelling key benefits over traditional (on-premises) virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) services and competing services from other cloud vendors.

## Costs
The cost to the customer for WVD is composed of 3 elements:
1. The Azure costs to host the "session host" virtual machines as well as any supporting infrastructure
2. The Microsoft 365 license cost for end-user access to the service
3. The license costs for control plane access (Citrix & VMWare are licenses separately, Microsoft (Native) control plane is free).

## WVD vs Citrix Cloud & VMWare Horizon Cloud
All the benefits of WVD on Azure are available to be accessed either natively as a Microsoft 1st-party service or through our partners at Citrix and VMWare. If your customer already leverages the capabilities of Citrix or VMWare Horizon in their business and wants to migrate their VDI service to the cloud, all the benefits of WVD on Azure can be unlocked while retaining the Citrix or VMWare control plane, clients and tooling they are familiar with.
